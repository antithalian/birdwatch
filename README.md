# birdwatch

## what is this thing?
`birdwatch` is a Python CLI app for downloading full-resolution version of images posted to Twitter. Making it mostly for downloading cool rocket pictures, but, hey, maybe it'll be useful for other stuff. The "how" of how it works is heavily inspired by jclishman's [SpaceXMirrorBot](https://github.com/jclishman/SpaceXMirrorBot), which does a similar thing but for r/SpaceX on Reddit.

## how do I use this thing?
haven't quite gotten that far yet!
